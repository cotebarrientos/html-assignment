                <strong>Crochet knitting</strong>
                <p>
                    It's something I've been doing since I was 10 years old, and my grandmother was who taught me. Nowadays, my house is full of crochets 
                    made by me.

                <strong>Drawing and painting</strong> 
                <p>
                    When I have time and feel inspired, I like drawing on my tablet or using my pc with a graphic tablet. My favourite software that I enjoy 
                    using are the following: <em>Krita, Ibis paint, Affinity Designer, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</em> I also like painting in the 
                    traditional way, either with oil paints or acrylics.

                <strong>Making crafts</strong> 
                <p>
                    In general I'm a very creative person and I enjoy creating things with my hands. I've made different things from <em>jewellery boxes</em>
                     to <em>custom dolls</em>. About custom dolls, I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgDSNdQ03y2qtk7cvyf9eDA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> about it with more than 15.000 subscribers.
